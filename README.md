# Math Expressions Dataset with Handwritten Datasets

This is an open-source dataset of handwritten mathematical expressions, where each sample is annotated with quadrilateral bounding boxes that represent the boundaries of the expressions, along with additional metadata. The dataset can be used for training and testing mathematical formula recognition, image processing, deep learning, and related tasks.

## Data Format

Each annotation file in the `train_gts/` and `test_gts/` directories contains several quadrilateral bounding boxes, with the format as follows:

```
25,40,258,15,262,53,30,77,HME
27,89,274,64,279,97,35,129,HME
243,134,336,119,345,168,253,182,HME
120,172,178,164,184,192,127,199,HME
70,131,79,169,254,141,245,105,HME
```

Each line represents one quadrilateral bounding box with coordinates (`x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4`), followed by an additional label (e.g., "HME"). These coordinates define the boundaries of the mathematical expressions in the image.

## Dataset Statistics

The dataset contains the following statistics:

## Dataset Statistics

The statistics of the self-collected dataset are as follows:

| Index                           | Value             |
|---------------------------------|-------------------|
| Number of samples               | 798               |

| Number of overlapping expressions | 1368             |
| Mean aspect ratio of expressions | 3.72              |
| Max aspect ratio of expressions  | 24.56             |
| Mean distance between expressions | 1.52 pixels      |

## Usage


### Data Overview

- The images are stored in the `train_images/` and `test_images/` directories.
- The ground truth annotations are stored in the `train_gts/` and `test_gts/` directories.
- The `train_list.txt` and `test_list.txt` files contain pairs of image filenames.
